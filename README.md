# mminv-calc
Tool to calculate the Modular Multiplicative Inverse geometrically.

Using graphical method to compute roots for equation f(x) = (b*floor(x) mod m) - 1 (the inverses modulo m): basically just solving one linear equation, equation which is computed from the properties of the graph of f(x), no euclidean algorithm needed.


Running times & asymptotic efficiency: (coming soon)
